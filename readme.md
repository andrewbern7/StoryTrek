## Description
This is a little brainchild of mine. Program focus is to create a random character with detailled atrributes and allow users to step generations. Current implementation produces a character with randomized name, gender, age, birthday, and soon even more pychsical attributes. Personality and mental health is also planned. 

## Contribution Ideas 
If interested current expansion ideas
-Constructive crticism! I know I am an idiot and make stupid mistakes, always open to new ideas. Particularly, modularity, cleanliness, faster information handling, and ANYTHING regarding charater traits and storing them.
- Race/Nationality and assigning relevant First/Surnames whilst still remaining random

# Main Focus
To create an application that generates meaningful family trees that allow the easy weaving of Sci-Fi stories (A framework). 

### Current Ideas
- While the theme is Sci-Fi I think it's important to prioritize functionality over features.
  - Biggest drawback, characters will only be human
  - I plan to procedural generate a backstory with the ID with traits that can be derived from experiences in one's backstory. ** BIG MAYBE ** , I am and idiot and worry procedural narrative geration will  be too hard to make and enjoyable experience to look with some level of randomness.
  - Make a license template to display the data to user. Use GPT-4 to generate a image of the character based off their traits.
