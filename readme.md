## Description
This is a little brainchild of mine. The first goal is to be able to generate a "space ID" (basically a driver's license) to prove procedural character generation and trait assignment.

### Current Ideas
- While the theme is Sci-Fi I think it's important to prioritize functionality over features.
  - Biggest drawback, characters will only be human
  - I plan to procedural generate a backstory with the ID with traits that can be derived from experiences in one's backstory.
- Make a license template to display the data to user. Use GPT-4 to generate a image of the character based off their traits.
